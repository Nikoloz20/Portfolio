            <p class="first-description" data-translate="firstDescription">I have strong expertise in back-end development, and it’s where my true passion lies. Compared to front-end, back-end development excites me more due to the variety of complex and powerful features it offers.</p>
            <p class="second-description" data-translate="secondDescription">Most of my work is done in <strong>Visual Studio 2022</strong>, which I am highly proficient in. I’ve mastered almost every feature of it, making it my most comfortable and productive environment. Occasionally, I also use JetBrains Rider. I am also highly skilled in using the terminal within Visual Studio, especially when it comes to solving challenging problems like database errors, Connection problems between classes and migration issues. I know exactly where to look and how to resolve them efficiently.</p>
            <p class="third-description" data-translate="thirdDescription">My experience includes working with one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships, with a strong understanding of their concepts and practical implementation. I enjoy designing and managing database relationships and ensuring smooth data interaction across applications.</p>
