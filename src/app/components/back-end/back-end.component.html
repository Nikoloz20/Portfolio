            <p class="first-description">I have strong expertise in back-end development, and it’s where my true passion lies. Compared to front-end, back-end development excites me more due to the variety of complex and powerful features it offers.</p>
            <p class="second-description">Most of my work is done in Visual Studio 2022, which I am highly proficient in. I’ve mastered almost every feature of it, making it my most comfortable and productive environment. Occasionally, I also use JetBrains Rider. I am also highly skilled in using the terminal within Visual Studio, especially when it comes to solving challenging problems like database errors, Connection problems between classes and migration issues. I know exactly where to look and how to resolve them efficiently.</p>
            <p class="third-description">My experience includes working with one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships, with a strong understanding of their concepts and practical implementation. I enjoy designing and managing database relationships and ensuring smooth data interaction across applications.</p>

         <p class="fourth-description">While it's sometimes difficult to showcase back-end projects since they’re not like front-end websites you can easily host, I’ve shared my work on GitHub. Feel free to explore my repositories and don’t forget to read the README files. they contain valuable insights about each project.</p>

         <p class="fifth-description">Over the past year, I have dedicated myself to learning back-end development and continue to grow my skills every day. I’ve completed two significant projects using console applications, where I invested a lot of time refining my problem-solving and coding abilities.</p>
         <p class="sixth-description">I also have experience with ASP.NET and building RESTful APIs. One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned is the importance of project organization, especially when working on larger systems. Keeping code clean and structured is something I take pride in.</p>
