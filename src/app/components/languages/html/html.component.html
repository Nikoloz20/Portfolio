            <p class="html-page-first-description">In the past, I would write complex HTML code to get the desired structure, not knowing yet how easy it would become with frameworks like Angular. Now, with the experience I've gained, I have realized that HTML has become much simpler. Thanks to Angular and modern tools, the number of lines in an HTML file has reduced drastically, making it cleaner and easier to manage. Of course, the complexity still depends on API and the type of page you're building, but it's far less overwhelming compared to how it used to be.</p>

Comments make it easier to understand the code later, especially when you come back to it after a while. They act as reminders, helping me recall why I wrote certain parts of the code, even if it is been some time since I worked on the project.</p>
