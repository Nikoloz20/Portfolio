                <p class="description">I have extensive experience in data management and SQL, which allows me to write efficient and clean SQL queries. While I often use C# and Entity Framework to create tables and manage databases, I still excel at writing raw SQL code when needed.</p>
                <p class="second-description">My approach to SQL development is grounded in rigorous testing. I always start by testing my queries in a local environment on a test database with sample tables before executing them in a live setting. This ensures that I can verify the accuracy of the logic, especially when working with complex transactions. This practice helps me avoid errors and guarantees that my SQL code functions correctly.</p>

                <p class="description">In SQL, Iâ€™m proficient in creating tables, inserting data, managing transactions, and sorting data. The process I follow in SQL is similar to how I handle data in C# and Entity Framework, but I take care to ensure that my SQL code is as efficient and readable as possible.</p>
                <p class="second-description">Just like in other programming languages, I make it a point to write clear comments in my SQL code. Since SQL queries are typically written in a single query file, it's essential to maintain well-structured and well-documented code for future reference and collaboration.</p>
