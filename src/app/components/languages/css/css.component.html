In 2023, I worked with CSS, but after that, I transitioned entirely to SCSS and never looked back. Angular has built-in support for SCSS, so no extra configuration is needed, it integrates seamlessly. However, when working outside Angular, I use an SCSS compiler to convert my styles into CSS.
                While I no longer use CSS directly, understanding it was essential for mastering SCSS. If you want to see my expertise in styling websites, check out my SCSS page</p>
